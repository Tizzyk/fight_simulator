#MMA Fight Simulation App

The purpose of this app is to allow a user to simulate a fight between two professional MMA fighters based on individual attributes. Fighters from any weight class can be matched up, but they must fight the same gender.

#Code Example

#Motivation

This project was created as my Capstone project for Thinkful's Python course. As an MMA fan I thought it would be fun project and eventually the goal is to create a strong enough prediction model with increased accuracy.
